# Learn classroom

Public ADHD-safe classroom. Own npm package in this git submodule (`https://github.com/pattynologies/learn.git`). Compose serves it on `:3000`. Production is `https://learn.pattynologies.com` (Pattynologies platform CDK + deploy). It is not a `@pattynologies/angular` project.

## Language

**Track**:
Ordered path of lessons. Today: `first-contact-email`.
_Avoid_: course, curriculum folder as the runtime catalog

**Lesson**:
One sitting. 6–8 steps. Public source repo.
_Avoid_: quiz, streak, expiry

**Step**:
One idea on screen. Ticked on this device.
