# Learn

Small AWS lessons. One step at a time. Written to be safe for ADHD brains: one screen, no streaks, no quizzes, nothing that expires.

This repository is the **classroom website** (Angular 22 CSR) and the markdown curriculum.

## Run the classroom

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Production: [learn.pattynologies.com](https://learn.pattynologies.com).

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Progress and prefs stay in the browser. Nothing is sent to a server.

## The path

**First contact email** — scaffold an umbrella, send mail with `Mikepattyn.Email`, wire `Mikepattyn.Contact.Api` as an API Gateway Lambda, then contrast that door with a Function URL.
